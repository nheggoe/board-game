 * <p>This is a sealed interface that serves as the base type for all Monopoly-specific tile types,

 * kinds of tiles found on the game board, such as: - Corner tiles, such as Free Parking or Jail -
 * Ownable tiles, representing properties or utilities - Tax tiles, where players must pay certain
 * amounts h
 *
 * <p>Permitted subtypes are: - {@link CornerMonopolyTile}: Represents corner tiles like Start,
 * Jail, etc. - {@link OwnableMonopolyTile}: Represents tiles that can be owned, such as properties
 * or utilities. - {@link TaxMonopolyTile}: Represents tax tiles where players pay specific
 * percentages.
