/**
 * Represents a specific type of tile in the Monopoly game that occupies a corner position on the
 * board.
 *
 * <p>This class is an abstract sealed type, permitting only specific subclasses to model the
 * distinct functionalities of various corner tiles, such as Free Parking, Go to Jail, Jail, and
 * Start. The use of sealed typing ensures precise subclass control, enhancing type safety and
 * maintainability.
 *
 * <p>A CornerMonopolyTile has an associated position, constrained to one of four predefined corner
 * positions on the board: TOP_LEFT, TOP_RIGHT, BOTTOM_LEFT, or BOTTOM_RIGHT. The {@link Position}
 * enum defines these positions.
 *
 * <p>This class provides: - Validation to ensure that the position cannot be null during
 * construction. - A method to access the tile's position. - A default string representation that
 * includes the class name and position.
 *
 * <p>Permitted subclasses modeling different corner tiles are: {@link FreeParkingMonopolyTile},
 * {@link GoToJailMonopolyTile}, {@link JailMonopolyTile}, and {@link StartMonopolyTile}.
