/**
 * Represents an abstract base for events used within the application.
 *
 * <p>This sealed interface is designed to define a common type for all event instances, enabling
 * the system to process and distinguish between different types of events. It ensures type safety
 * by restricting the permitted implementations to a predefined set of classes.
 *
 * <p>Each permitted implementation defines a specific type of event, carrying relevant information
 * that can be published, listened to, and handled by the appropriate components within the system.
 *
 * <p>This interface works in conjunction with other components such as {@link EventBus}, {@link
 * EventListener}, and {@link EventPublisher} to allow for event-driven programming paradigms.
