/**
 * Represents a mechanism for publishing events and managing event listeners.
 *
 * <p>The EventPublisher interface provides methods for registering, deregistering, and notifying
 * listeners of specific event types. Implementations of this interface are responsible for
 * maintaining the mappings between event types and their corresponding listeners, as well as
 * ensuring appropriate dispatching of events to those listeners.
 *
 * <p>It is designed to facilitate an event-driven architecture, where various components can react
 * to occurrences represented as events without direct coupling between the publishers and
 * listeners.
 *
 * <p>Responsibilities of implementing classes include: - Allowing the addition of listeners for
 * specific event types. - Allowing the removal of listeners for specific event types. - Dispatching
 * published events to all relevant listeners in a type-safe manner.
 *
 * <p>This interface is particularly useful in systems where decoupling components is beneficial for
 * scalability, modularity, or testability.
